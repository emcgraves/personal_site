            <h3>What happens when you cross a creative writer with a data nerd? You get me! </h3>
            <p>
            Not many people with a degree in the arts go on to study data science and AI. Growing up, I always felt like STEM and the humanities were two separate camps, and that everyone had to choose either one or the other. Despite being a very logical child, it seemed obvious that I belonged to the humanities. I was always reading, writing stories, creating art, and performing. However, once I graduated university with a bachelor’s in writing for film and TV, I wasn’t so sure that was where I was meant to be. A contracting job led me to logistics tech company where I started in Operations, before moving on to Learning & Development. This was where I fell in love with data. I found working with it immensely satisfying—so much so that I decided I wanted to go back to school to study it. In the beginning of my studies, I felt out of place in the Computer Science department. I didn’t grow up coding or loving mathematics like a lot of the other students. However, as time went on, I began to see my unique background as an asset. Being great at coding and analysis is important, but data means very little if you can’t tell a story with it. 
            <br><br>
            Now I know that choosing between STEM and the humanities is a false dichotomy. I can choose logic AND creativity. I can merge my worlds, and be stronger for it. </p>
